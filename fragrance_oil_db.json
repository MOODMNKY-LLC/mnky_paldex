In fact, we almost called it Naughty Santal.\n\nIn finished products, subtle top notes of fennel, ginger, and cardamom accentuate mid notes of rich amber, cedar, clover, and lavender. We\u2019ve found that out of the bottle (OOB), this scent smells slightly sweeter than in the finished product.\n\nUpscale home decor or luxury lines would benefit from the addition of this scent. It performs well in candles, melts, and tarts and also makes tantalizing soaps, lotions, and scrubs.\n\nThis fragrance is infused with essential oils, including cedarwood, patchouli, eucalyptus, elemi, carrot seed, cedar, coriander, clove leaf, nutmeg, fennel, caraway, orange sweet, and pine.\n\nBlends well with: Toasted Coconut, Apricot Grove, Fig Tree, Rose and Oud,\u00a0Autumn Glow, Bohemian Rose, Forest Chai\n\nAlternative branding ideas: Santal, Naughty Santal, Sandalwood and Cedar, Sandalwood Cashmere\n\nSuggested colors: Light Tan, Light Yellow\n\nSee our complete list of candle making dyes and soap colorants.\n\n\u00a0",

We put lots of research and development into figuring out why the chemistry just doesn't work. This fragrance is the result of all that work. While it is a 2/3 in soy (just leaves us room to keep trying), it is the best we've ever seen, and we think you'll agree.\n\nBlends well with: Mimosa and Mandarin, Very Vanilla, Blue Spruce\n\nAlternative branding ideas: Pink Grapefruit, Grapefruit Vanilla, Seaside Citrus\n\nSuggested colors: Orange, Yellow\n\nSee our complete list of candle making dyes\u00a0and soap colorants.",
